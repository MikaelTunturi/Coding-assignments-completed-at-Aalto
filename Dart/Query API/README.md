# Query API

In this exercise, a mobile application is implemented for displaying questions following the provided instructions. The mobile application utilizes an API that provides JSON-formatted data online.

The functionality to be built for the application is as follows:

The application consists of two views: the home view and the survey view.

In the home view, the user is greeted: if the user has not used the application before, they are shown the text "Tervetuloa!", otherwise they are shown the text "Heippa taas!". Additionally, the home view contains a button labeled "Kysy kysymys!". Pressing this button navigates the user to the survey view.

In the survey view, the user is presented with a question and answer options. When the user selects one of the answer options, the application checks if the answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the user is shown the text "Oikein meni!". If the answer is incorrect, the user is shown the text "Väärin meni, hups!". In either case, the user is also shown a button labeled "Seuraava!".

When the user presses the "Seuraava!" button, a new question is displayed to the user.

The specific instructions for the project were provided on the course website.
